\section{Introduction}

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines a retriever and a generator.
The retriever fetches relevant documents, and the generator conditions on them
to produce an answer.

A simple scoring function might be:
\[
s(q, d) = \text{sim}(q, d) + \lambda \cdot \text{confidence}(d)
\]

\section{A Toy Theorem}

Consider a simple inequality used in analysis of loss functions:

\[
L(\theta) \leq \hat{L}(\theta) + C \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}}
\]

Here, $L(\theta)$ is the population loss, $\hat{L}(\theta)$ is the empirical loss,
$n$ is the number of samples, and $C$ is a constant.

\section{Conclusion}

In practice, RAG systems must balance retrieval quality and model budget.
Future work includes better reranking, caching, and dynamic context selection.
